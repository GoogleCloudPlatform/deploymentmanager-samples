# Deprecation Notice
This code is deprecated, and is not guaranteed to work in any way. If you want to deploy Lustre on Google Cloud, it is recommended that you consider using the [Managed Lustre service](https://cloud.google.com/products/managed-lustre?hl=en), or
deploying [DDN EXAScaler Lustre using the Cluster Toolkit](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cluster-toolkit/tree/main/community/modules/file-system/DDN-EXAScaler).

# Lustre Deployment Manager Script

This is a Deployment Manager script to deploy a Lustre parallel file system cluster on Google Cloud Platform. This tool deploys the open source Lustre RPMs available on whamcloud.com.

This script deploys a MDS/MGS combined node, and N OSS nodes. On both node types the IP addresses, machine type, disk type, and disk size are all configurable in the lustre.yaml file.

Please note: This software is provided as-is, with no guarantees of support. This is an example script, and should be used as such.
There are partner-provided and supported Lustre options available in the Google Cloud Marketplace.

## Planning and Design

Before beginning to configure these deployment manager scripts, plan your Lustre cluster by evaluating your requirements, including: How many files do you need to store, how many open/stat/close operations will you perform per second, how much data capacity you require, and how much read/write throughput you need to that data.

When configuring the Metadata Server, you must size the instance to provide the necessary performance. Nodes under 8 cores will be limited by network throttling. When configuring the Metadata Target (MDT), plan for 4KB of capacity per file (inode). See more details on planning for inodes [here](http://wiki.lustre.org/Lustre_Tuning). Local-ssd provides the highest level of performance, but it's size is limited to a total of 3TB across 8 Local SSD devices. If you specify more than 3TB, the capacity will be limited to 3TB. See [this page](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/performance) for detailed disk performance characteristics.

When configuring the Object Storage Server (OSS), you must size the instance to provide the necessary performance. Nodes under 8 cores will be limited by the network. With n1-standard-8 Object Storage Server instances the Lustre file system can achieve 80-95% of the underlying disk performance. When sizing the Object Storage Targets (OST) ensure that you have sufficient capacity for your data. Total file system capacity grows linearly with the number of Object Storage Servers; so two OSSs, each with the same size OST disk, will have exactly twice as much capacity as a single OSS. Performance in nearly linear, with 95-100% linear performance on GCP as you scale up. Local-ssd provides the highest level of performance, but it's size is limited to a total of 3TB across 8 Local SSD devices. If you specify more than 3TB, the capacity will be limited to 3TB. See [this page](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/performance) for detailed disk performance characteristics.

## Configuration

The Lustre cluster to be deployed is configured using the lustre.yaml configuration file. This file is designed to maximize flexibility. In many cases you may not need to change many of these fields.

The lustre.yaml file has the following fields. The fields with a \* following their name are required (such as cluster_name below), all others are optional. A short description and example inputs can also be found in the lustre-template.yaml file.

## Launch the Lustre Cluster

Once you've customized the lustre.yaml file and completed all the required fields, and ensure you have adequate [resource quota](https://cloud.google.com/compute/quotas), you are ready to launch your Lustre cluster.

Use the following command to launch your Lustre cluster:

    gcloud deployment-manager deployments create lustre --config lustre.yaml

Once the cluster is deployed, ssh in to the MDS instance. You may notice a message indicating that the Lustre filesystem is still being installed, and that you will be notified when the process is complete. Please wait until you see a second message reporting the installation complete, and providing the sample mount command for your cluster.

## Mount the Lustre filesystem

Once the nodes are installed and the filesystem is online you're ready to mount your clients. Install the [Lustre client software](http://wiki.lustre.org/Installing_the_Lustre_Software#Lustre_Client_Software_Installation) on an instance that is routable to the Lustre cluster's subnet. Once installed, and with the Lustre module loaded, use the following mount command to mount your filesystem:

    mount -t lustre < MDS #1 Hostname >:< MDS #N Hostname >:/< FS NAME > < LOCAL MOUNT >

An example would be:

    mount -t lustre lustre-mds1:/lustre /mnt/lustre

You may use the Lustre Metadata Server (MDS) to test if the clients can mount the filesystem. It is best practice not to leave the filesystem mounted on the MDS server long-term.

Once the filesystem is mounted you will see no output returned with the mount command. You can verify the filesystem is mounted by checking the "mount" command, and by running "sudo lfs df".

Next, try running a simple fio write test to a single file on the Lustre filesystem. Then, assuming you're using >1 OSS, use the following command to configure a new file with [Lustre File Striping](http://wiki.lustre.org/Configuring_Lustre_File_Striping) to distribute the write across as many Object Storage Servers (OSS) as possible with a stripe count of -1:

    lfs setstripe -c -1 /mnt/lustre/testfile_stripe_wide

Now rerun the test to see the increased performance!

### Expanding the Lustre cluster
Expanding your existing Lustre cluster is a simple process. First, update your lustre.yaml file to the new Lustre configuration by increasing the number of OSS instances in the oss_node_count field. Changing disk size, instance profile, disk type, or reducing the oss_node_count is not tested or supported.

Next, run this command to update the deployment:

    gcloud deployment-manager deployments update lustre --config lustre.yaml

Your additional OSS instances will come online and install and configure Lustre themselves through the startup-script. They will then add themselves to the Lustre cluster, and will become visible to the clients. You can see the new OSS is online by running the following command:

    sudo lfs df

Once you add an OSS and it's OSTs, the new storage space will become available, and any files or directories with a stripecount equal to -1 will automatically begin writing new data to the new storage space. However, data written to the initial OSS instances will not migrate to the new space. Data can be migrated manually by making a copy of the data and deleting the old copy.

## Troubleshooting

### Lustre Installation
If the message that the Lustre installation is complete does not appear after 5-10 minutes, and a cluster reboot, please check /var/log/messages to see the messages prefaced by "startup-script:". If there is a bug please submit feedback according to the Feedback section below.

### Lustre Client Mounting
If you receive a "Connection timed out" error while mounting a client check "lctl ping < NODE Hostname / IP >" to ensure that the nodes can communicate over [LNET](http://wiki.lustre.org/Lustre_Networking_(LNET)_Overview). If you receive an Input/Output error please ensure that the firewall rules, routing and VPC networking is configured correctly. 

Refer to the Lustre Wiki page [Mounting a Lustre File System on Client Nodes](http://wiki.lustre.org/Mounting_a_Lustre_File_System_on_Client_Nodes) for more information.

### Lustre Community
The largest source of information for Lustre is the [Lustre wiki](http://lustre.org/), and the [Lustre mailing lists](http://lustre.org/mailing-lists/). If you experience issues with Lustre itself, please refer to those resources first.
